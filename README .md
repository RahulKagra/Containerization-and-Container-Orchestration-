# MERN with Microservices
This project simulates a production-grade cloud-native deployment workflow, showcasing how modern DevOps practices enable scalable, automated, and reliable application delivery on AWS

# Use Case

Build and deploy a containerized MERN application with separate microservices (frontend, hello service, profile service).
Implement CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate Docker image builds and push them to Amazon ECR.
Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Python (Boto3) to provision AWS infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Auto Scaling Groups, Load Balancer).
Deploy services on EC2 instances with Docker managed by Auto Scaling Groups.
Route traffic through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with health checks.
Enable monitoring & logging via Amazon CloudWatch.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

DevOps: Jenkins, Docker, Boto3 (Python), Infrastructure as Code
Application Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

```


For `helloService`, create `.env` file with the content:
```bash
PORT=3001
```

For `profileService`, create `.env` file with the content:
```bash
PORT=3002
MONGO_URL="specifyYourMongoURLHereWithDatabaseNameInTheEnd"
```

Finally install packages in both the services by running the command `npm install`.

<br/>
For frontend, you have to install and start the frontend server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Note: This will run the frontend in the development server. To run in production, build the application by running the command `npm run build`
